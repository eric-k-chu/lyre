## Roadmap
- [x] install script to download latest binaries
- [ ] additional args (If you're using any additional args you should probably use the cli)

## Progress Bar
The way yt-dlp downloads the videos makes it rather difficult to display a progress bar. Because it downloads the video and audio separately, it emits different progress statuses for them. This is why this app and most apps display the raw output instead.
